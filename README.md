# ⭕️ Rules & Tasks

> One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

> A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.

> Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

> All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.

# ✅ Tests

rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC") should decode to the string FREE CODE CAMP</br>
Waiting:rot13("SERR CVMMN!") should decode to the string FREE PIZZA!</br>
Waiting:rot13("SERR YBIR?") should decode to the string FREE LOVE?</br>
Waiting:rot13("GUR DHVPX OEBJA SBK WHZCF BIRE GUR YNML QBT.") should decode to the string THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG.</br>
